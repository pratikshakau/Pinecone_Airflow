# Pinecone_Airflow
This project runs a full Pinecone vector search pipeline using Apache Airflow on Docker. It includes installing sentence-transformers, configuring Pinecone, preprocessing data, creating an index, generating embeddings, ingesting them into Pinecone, and running a semantic search — with screenshots of each Airflow task.
